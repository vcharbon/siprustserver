//! sip-clock — the clock seam (slice 0 of the migration; re-expression of the
//! source's Effect `Clock` / `TestClock`).
//!
//! # Why this exists (and why it is *narrow*)
//!
//! Effect's `Clock`/`TestClock` did two jobs through one runtime-injected seam:
//! it answered "what time is it?" (the `nowMs` value flowing into deadline math)
//! **and** "wake me later" (scheduling). In Rust those split:
//!
//! - **Behaviour — timers, deadlines, idle-sweeps, windows — runs on monotonic
//!   time via `tokio::time` directly** (`sleep`, `sleep_until`, `interval`,
//!   `timeout`, `Instant`). `tokio::time::pause`/`advance` is the universal test
//!   lever for all of it, ambient within the runtime exactly as Effect's
//!   `TestClock` was ambient within the Effect runtime. There is **no trait
//!   wrapping** of scheduling — wrapping it would re-implement a worse tokio.
//! - **Wall-clock `now_ms()` is for timestamps only** — log lines, call records.
//!   It is *not* a behavioural input (no deadline is computed from it). It is the
//!   one thing `tokio::time::pause` cannot bend (pause moves the monotonic clock,
//!   not `SystemTime`), so it gets the injectable seam here.
//!
//! # The construction
//!
//! [`Clock::now_ms`] is **monotonic-anchored**: `anchor_wall_ms +
//! elapsed_since_anchor`, where the elapsed is measured against
//! `tokio::time::Instant`. Two consequences fall out for free:
//!
//! - In prod the timestamp never jumps backward (it rides the monotonic clock),
//!   at the cost of drifting from true wall time over long uptime — fine for
//!   logs/records; read [`std::time::SystemTime`] directly at the rare call site
//!   that must reconcile with an external wall clock (a SIP `Date` header, a
//!   cross-system billing record).
//! - In tests the elapsed rides the **same** monotonic clock `tokio::time`
//!   controls, so a single `tokio::time::advance(d)` moves the behavioural timers
//!   **and** `now_ms()` together, consistently. No separately-settable
//!   `TestClock` counter is needed — pause/advance is the one lever.
//!
//! # HA note — failover timer reconstruction (landed)
//!
//! Monotonic `Instant`s are not portable across processes / restarts / replicas,
//! so a replicated timer can never ship a raw `Instant`. The failover slice chose
//! the **absolute-wall-deadline** option: each `call::TimerEntry` carries
//! `fire_at` as an epoch-ms deadline (`now_ms()` at schedule time + the delay),
//! which IS replicated as part of the `Call`. On takeover the standby rebuilds its
//! local monotonic timer from that deadline — see
//! `b2bua::timers::TimerService::restore`.
//!
//! Consequence — **this is the one place `now_ms()` is a *behavioural*,
//! cross-node input.** Everywhere else it is timestamps only; and even the timer
//! driver's `fire_at - now_ms()` is *not* load-bearing within a single process,
//! because `fire_at` was minted from that same `now_ms()` and the two readings
//! cancel (the delay reduces to the original `delay_ms`). Across a failover they
//! do not cancel: a `fire_at` minted on the dead node is compared against the live
//! node's `now_ms()`, so the rearmed deadline is only as accurate as the two
//! nodes' **wall clocks agree** (keep them NTP-disciplined), plus each node's
//! monotonic drift from true wall over its uptime. Skew shifts the rearmed
//! deadline earlier/later by the disagreement; a past-due `fire_at` clamps to a
//! zero delay and fires immediately. See docs/MIGRATION_PLAN_B2B.md §2.
